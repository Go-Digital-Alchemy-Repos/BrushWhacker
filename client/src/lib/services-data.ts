    intro: "One machine. One pass. Brush, saplings, and understory ground into clean mulch — no burning, no hauling, no topsoil damage.",
    overview: "Forestry mulching uses a single machine — a skid steer fitted with a high-speed mulching head — to grind brush, saplings, and undergrowth directly into the soil. Unlike chainsaws, bulldozers, and burn piles, it handles everything in one pass with zero debris to haul away. The mulching head shreds vegetation into wood chips that suppress weeds, retain moisture, and prevent erosion.\n\nProperty owners across Mecklenburg, Union, and Cabarrus Counties choose forestry mulching because it's typically 30–50% less expensive than traditional clearing. No burn permits, no topsoil loss, no hauling crews. Our operators can selectively clear around mature trees, structures, and features you want to keep — transforming overgrown land into usable property in a fraction of the time.",

    pricingFactors: "Forestry mulching is typically priced by the acre based on vegetation density, terrain difficulty, and accessibility. Because there's no hauling or disposal, it's often 30-50% less expensive than traditional clearing. Densely wooded areas with larger saplings cost more than light brush. Request a free on-site estimate for accurate pricing on your Charlotte-area property.",
    faqs: [
      { q: "How is forestry mulching different from bulldozing or traditional clearing?", a: "Bulldozing strips the topsoil, destroys root systems, and creates massive debris piles that need to be hauled or burned. Forestry mulching grinds everything in place — no hauling trucks, no burn permits, no topsoil loss. The mulch left behind actually improves soil health and prevents erosion. It's faster, cleaner, and usually cheaper." },
      { q: "What size trees can your mulcher handle?", a: "Our forestry mulcher head handles saplings and trees up to approximately 6\u20138 inches in diameter. Larger trees can be felled first, then the stumps and slash are mulched. We'll assess your specific vegetation during the free estimate and plan the right approach." },
      { q: "Can you clear around specific trees I want to keep?", a: "Absolutely. Selective clearing is one of the biggest advantages of forestry mulching over bulldozing. We can work precisely around any trees, structures, or features you want to preserve. Just walk us through your priorities during the estimate." },
      { q: "How long does forestry mulching take?", a: "Most residential projects in the Charlotte area are completed in 1\u20132 days. A typical half-acre lot with moderate brush can often be finished in a single day. Larger acreage projects are scheduled based on density and terrain. We'll give you a timeline during your estimate." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "How wide can you cut a trail?", a: "We cut trails from narrow 4-foot walking paths up to 12+ foot vehicle access lanes. The width depends on your intended use — foot traffic, ATV, truck access, or equipment access. We'll recommend the right width based on how you plan to use the trail." },
      { q: "Can you cut trails on hilly or uneven ground?", a: "Yes. Our equipment handles rough terrain, slopes, and uneven ground. We evaluate the terrain during the estimate and plan routes that work with the natural contours of your land rather than fighting them." },
      { q: "Will the trail be usable immediately after cutting?", a: "In most cases, yes. After clearing and mulching, the trail surface is walkable and typically driveable for ATVs and lighter vehicles. For heavy truck access, you may need gravel or additional grading, which we can coordinate." },
      { q: "Can you cut trails to connect to existing paths or roads?", a: "Absolutely. We frequently tie new trails into existing driveways, farm roads, or established paths. We'll walk the route with you beforehand so the final product connects exactly where you need it." },

    h1: "Hillside Mulching & Slope Clearing Near Charlotte, NC",
    intro: "Steep slopes, rough banks, tough terrain — we clear where other crews won't, leaving a protective mulch layer that fights erosion.",
    overview: "Hillside mulching is specialized land clearing for steep slopes, embankments, and terrain where conventional equipment can't safely operate. Across Gaston County, Lincoln County, and the Lake Norman shoreline, overgrown slopes create real problems — trapped moisture accelerates erosion, dense brush becomes a fire hazard, and hidden gullies undermine hillside stability. Bulldozing is especially destructive on slopes, stripping away the topsoil and root networks that hold the hill together.\n\nOur approach uses tracked equipment rated for steep grades with mulching heads that grind vegetation in place, preserving soil structure and root systems. The mulch layer acts as a natural erosion blanket — absorbing rainfall and slowing runoff. We selectively preserve anchor trees for critical slope stability, leaving a cleared hillside that's actually more resistant to erosion than before. This is especially valuable for lakefront properties and residential lots with significant grade changes.",

    pricingFactors: "Hillside mulching pricing reflects the added complexity of working on slopes. Factors include the grade of the slope, density of vegetation, accessibility for equipment staging, and total area. Steeper grades and limited access points increase the cost. We provide free on-site estimates so we can assess the terrain firsthand before quoting your Gaston or Lincoln County project.",
    faqs: [
      { q: "How steep of a slope can you clear?", a: "We regularly work on slopes of 30\u201335+ degrees using equipment and techniques designed for hillside work. During the estimate, we assess the specific grade, soil conditions, and access points to determine the safest and most effective approach for your property." },
      { q: "Won't clearing a hillside cause erosion?", a: "Not when it's done right. Forestry mulching leaves a thick layer of ground mulch that actually protects the soil and reduces erosion compared to the overgrown state. We also selectively preserve root systems and vegetation that provide slope stability. The result is a cleaner hillside with better erosion control." },
      { q: "Why do other companies turn down hillside work?", a: "Most land clearing companies use equipment that isn't rated for slopes, or their operators aren't trained for it. Working on grades requires specialized attachments, different techniques, and experience reading terrain. We've invested in the equipment and training specifically for this type of work." },
      { q: "Can you clear a hillside without damaging the slope?", a: "Yes. That's the core advantage of mulching over bulldozing on slopes. We grind vegetation in place without disturbing the soil structure or removing stabilizing root systems. The mulch layer we leave behind further protects the slope surface from water runoff." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "What's the difference between brush hogging and forestry mulching?", a: "Brush hogging uses a rotary mower to cut grass, weeds, and light brush at ground level — think of it as heavy-duty mowing. Forestry mulching uses a grinding head to chew through saplings, small trees, and dense brush, turning them into mulch. If your land is mostly open with tall grass and weeds, brush hogging is the right tool. If it's thick with saplings and woody growth, you need forestry mulching." },
      { q: "How tall can the grass and weeds be?", a: "Our brush hog handles growth of any height — from knee-high grass to 6+ foot weeds and light saplings up to 2\u20133 inches in diameter. If the growth is primarily woody brush or larger saplings, we may recommend forestry mulching instead." },
      { q: "Can you set up recurring mowing for my property?", a: "Yes. We offer monthly, quarterly, and seasonal brush hogging schedules for property owners who want to keep fields and lots maintained without the hassle. Recurring contracts get priority scheduling and reduced per-visit rates." },

We also provide follow-up recommendations for monitoring and maintenance." },
      { q: "What invasive species are most common in Charlotte?", a: "The Charlotte metro's biggest offenders are kudzu, Chinese privet, Japanese honeysuckle, wisteria, and English ivy.
