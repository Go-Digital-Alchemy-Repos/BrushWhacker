NON-DESTRUCTIVE: Build new admin pages and APIs without breaking public site.

Goal: Admin Portal with a mini CRM to manage inbound leads from the quote form.
Add the following:
- Admin layout and navigation
- Leads list with filters
- Lead detail view
- Status pipeline
- Notes + activity log
- Basic export CSV

AUTH:
If authentication already exists in the repo, use it to protect /admin routes.
If not, implement a simple admin auth:
- Create an Admin user table OR an env-based single admin password as temporary
- Session cookie or JWT (prefer secure cookie session)
- Protect /api/admin/* routes

CRM DATA MODEL (DB preferred):

- id (uuid)
- createdAt
- updatedAt

- accessNotes (text)
- desiredOutcome (text)
- timeline

- note (text)

lead_activity:

END-OF-PROMPT Docs Library update:
