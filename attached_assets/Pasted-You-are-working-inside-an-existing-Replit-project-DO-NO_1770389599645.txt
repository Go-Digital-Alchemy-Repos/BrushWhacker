You are working inside an existing Replit project. DO NOT remove, rename, or rewrite existing files unless absolutely required. Prefer creating NEW files and SMALL, safe additions. If you must change a file, keep changes minimal and clearly commented.

Goal: Initialize a full-stack web app for “BrushWhackers” (land clearing & brush removal) targeting the Charlotte, North Carolina area. Modern, beautiful, engaging. Brand color: BLUE. Use React front-end and Node/Express backend. Prepare for CMS + Admin portal + Docs Library + CRM leads.

TECH STACK (preferred):
- Frontend: React + Vite, React Router, TypeScript if already present (use existing stack)
- Styling: Tailwind if already present; if not present, add it in the least disruptive way, otherwise use CSS modules
- Backend: Node + Express
- Database: Postgres if already configured; otherwise add support using Prisma or Drizzle (choose whichever is already used; if none exists, choose Prisma for speed)
- Validation: zod (preferred) if available

NON-DESTRUCTIVE RULES:
- Do not break existing routes/components.
- Create new routes/pages/components rather than replacing old ones.
- Add environment variables via example file, do not commit secrets.

DELIVERABLES:
1) Add a shared design system:
   - Primary color: Blue (#1E5BFF or close)
   - Secondary: Slate/gray for text and backgrounds
   - Font: Inter (apply globally)
   - Create reusable components: Container, Button, Card, SectionHeader, CTA (Call-To-Action), FormField
   - Add a site-wide Layout: TopNav + Footer

2) Add a top navigation that includes:
   - Home
   - Services (dropdown)
   - Pricing
   - Blog
   - Get a Quote
   - (Admin link hidden or behind /admin)

3) Create empty route shells (pages) WITHOUT full content yet:
   - / (Home)
   - /services (Services overview)
   - /services/land-clearing
   - /services/brush-removal
   - /services/forestry-mulching
   - /services/lot-clearing
   - /services/stump-grinding
   - /services/driveway-trail-cutting
   - /services/storm-cleanup
   - /pricing
   - /blog
   - /blog/:slug
   - /quote

4) Add a lightweight “Stock Image” helper:
   - Use royalty-free stock image URLs (e.g., Unsplash) for now with heavy machinery: skid steers, forestry mulcher attachments, land clearing, brush cutting.
   - Keep images as constants in a single file so we can replace later.

5) Backend:
   - Add /api/health
   - Add basic Express server setup if not already present.
   - Add CORS + JSON parsing.
   - Add placeholder /api/public endpoints file structure.

6) Add Admin portal route shell (no auth yet):
   - /admin (dashboard shell)
   - /admin/leads (CRM leads list shell)
   - /admin/cms (content manager shell)
   - /admin/branding (branding settings shell)
   - /admin/docs (Docs Library shell)

Make sure routing works both in dev and production builds.

END-OF-PROMPT REQUIREMENT (Docs Library update):
- Create or update an Admin Portal section called “Docs Library”.
- Document ALL current routes (frontend + backend), components introduced, environment variables, and how to run the app locally.
- Location: Admin portal page /admin/docs must render the docs content from a backend endpoint /api/admin/docs (for now can be static JSON or markdown stored server-side).
- Ensure the docs mention “Phase 1: Baseline Architecture + Branding + Shared UI”.
