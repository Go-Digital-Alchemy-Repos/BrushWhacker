NON-DESTRUCTIVE: Extend existing pages, do not remove working code.

Goal:
1) Build a simple pricing page users can understand with 3 options that revolve around a $250-ish entry point and show value for longer commitments (lower hourly rate). Also include “By the Acre” for larger properties.
2) Build an interesting “Get a Quote” form that captures lead details and encourages the prospect to describe the project thoroughly.
3) Submit the quote form to backend API and store as a Lead for the Admin CRM.

Add a “What Affects Price” section:
- Vegetation density and stem size
- Terrain slope and ground conditions
- Access width (gates, driveways)
- Obstacles (fencing, rocks, debris, hidden stumps)
- Haul-off vs mulch-on-site
- Utility locate requirements

Add a “Common Questions” FAQ (5 Qs):
- Is the $250 a minimum?
- Do you haul debris away?
- Can you work in wet conditions?
- Do you require utility locates?
- How fast can I get scheduled?

Backend requirements:
- Create POST /api/public/leads to accept quote requests.
- Validate payload (zod).
- Store lead in DB table “leads”.
- If DB not set up yet, create a file-based fallback (JSON) that can later be migrated; but prefer DB if available.
- Return a leadId.

Security:
- Basic rate limiting per IP (simple in-memory ok for now).
- Basic spam honeypot field (hidden “company” input that must be empty).

END-OF-PROMPT Docs Library update:
- Document pricing model and disclaimers
- Document quote form fields and lead schema
- Document backend endpoint(s): method, path, request/response examples
- Document spam protections and rate limiting approach
- Ensure /admin/docs reflects “Phase 3: Pricing + Quote Form + Leads API”
