# Forestry Mulching in Charlotte, NC: The Fastest Way to Reclaim Overgrown Land
If you’ve got an overgrown lot in the Charlotte area—whether it’s in Matthews, Mint Hill, Huntersville, or out toward Union County—forestry mulching can be one of the most efficient ways to reset your property fast.
## What is forestry mulching?
Forestry mulching uses a skid steer equipped with a mulcher head to grind brush and small trees into mulch right on site. Instead of piling and burning or hauling, the vegetation is converted into ground cover.
## When mulching is a great fit around Charlotte
- Dense brush and saplings
- Trail and access lane creation
- Understory thinning without removing mature trees
- Property line cleanup for fencing projects
## What to expect
Most projects start with a quick discussion about access, terrain, and your end goal. From there, we clear selectively and leave a cleaner, more maintainable surface.
