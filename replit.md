## System Architecture
The application is built with a React + Vite frontend, a Node/Express backend, and a PostgreSQL database.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Frontend Framework**: React with Vite for fast development and TypeScript for type safety.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and Shadcn UI for pre-built, accessible components.
- **Branding System**: Site-wide branding is configurable via `site_settings` table, allowing dynamic updates to company name, contact info, logo, primary/secondary colors (HSL format for Tailwind compatibility), and font family. These settings are applied across the site and in the admin branding page with a live preview.
- **Color Scheme**: Earth tones are used throughout, featuring warm browns and sage greens. Light and dark modes are implemented with complementary palettes.
- **SEO Approach**: Each page utilizes unique titles and meta descriptions, incorporates regional keywords (Charlotte, NC), and features problem/solution messaging. A dynamic sitemap, robots.txt, JSON-LD structured data, and canonical URL support are included.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Passport.js with LocalStrategy handles admin login. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented with four roles (super_admin, admin, editor, sales), enforced by server-side middleware and frontend helpers.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL managed by Drizzle ORM.
- **API Endpoints**: Categorized into public, authentication, admin, and user management. Admin routes are protected by role-based middleware.
- **Caching**: Public endpoints leverage in-memory caching with ETag headers and Cache-Control for performance and bandwidth optimization. Cache invalidation is triggered by relevant admin mutations.
- **Content Management**: A full CMS supports blog posts with markdown editing, and includes features for media management, page revisions, and URL redirects.
- **CRM**: Manages leads with detailed tracking, notes, activity timelines, and an export function. Projects allow converting completed leads into portfolio galleries with before/after images. Testimonials manage customer reviews with star ratings for CMS blocks.
- **Dynamic CMS Blocks**: `project_gallery` and `testimonials_slider` blocks fetch published data from the API at render time, enabling drag-and-drop placement on any CMS page.
- **Services**: Six core services are defined, each with dedicated SEO-optimized pages.
- **Pricing Model**: Four tiers: Hourly, Half-Day, Full-Day, and By the Acre.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Modular Structure**: The project is organized into `client/`, `server/`, and `shared/` directories for clear separation of concerns.
- **Data Schemas**: Detailed Drizzle schemas for `users`, `admin_users`, `leads`, `blog_posts`, `site_settings`, `crm_projects`, `cms_testimonials`, and `docs_entries`.
- **Docs Governance**: Database-backed documentation system with 14 standardized categories, CRUD API, markdown editor with preview, quality validator, and `docsLogger` utility for programmatic doc creation. Docs are seeded from `server/docs-data.ts` on startup and stored in `docs_entries` table.
- **Admin Layout**: A role-aware sidebar navigation and authentication guards enhance the admin experience.
